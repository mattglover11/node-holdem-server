#node-holdem-server

A Texas Holdem game server that currently runs as a simulation. In the future this may evolve to either focus on multiplayer RTC, similulation only or as the basis for machine learning experimentation.

## Motivation

This project was developed with the sole intention for me to learn Node JS.


## Installation

Clone the repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:mattyglover/node-holdem-server.git
cd node-holdem-server
```

Run the simulation:
```
node server.js
```
